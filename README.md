**Overview:**
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive project that combines advanced computer vision techniques to perform Automatic License Plate Detection (ALPR) and Speed Estimation using state-of-the-art algorithms. The project employs YOLOv8 for license plate detection, SORT for object tracking, and EasyOCR for optical character recognition to achieve highly accurate and efficient results.


A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates. The model was trained with Yolov8 using [this dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4). The model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZKRejyvMO1870mSWH6MZu0lv28xWpSuz/view?usp=drive_link).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- SORT
- EasyOCR
- Numpy

**Note:** The sort module needs to be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/abewley/sort).
